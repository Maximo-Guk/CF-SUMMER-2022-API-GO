What new knowledge or skills did you take away from this project? If you learned a new language for this assignment, make sure to tell us.

I've never had experience with GO before so this was a new one for me for sure, it was fascinating, the pointers being
the biggest difference for me at least. I've also never built my own JWT verification system with claims, I used firebase admin SDK
on my express.js server before for my react native application that I built over the summer, however it handled most of the JWT side of things for you.

What was the most difficult part of this assignment?

The most difficult part of the assignment was learning the new language, especially one that's lower level then you're used to, however
it was a good experience. I also had lots of troubles with workers KV put requests not showing up once set, I'm fairly certain it's not user error as
I was using the provided KV workers typescript template.

Did you attempt any extra credit? Tell us what you chose

Yes I attempted all the extra credit that was listed. I also added a few of my own API endpoints on the worker side of things to allow for a voting system and
a emoticon system for the comment section.

By the way I noticed the systems autograder was saying that it had issues writing my result of 92% to my file, and it wasn't providing any feedback. Not sure if this is intentional!

It was a fun assignment, thank you!
